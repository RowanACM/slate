# Introduction

Welcome to the Rowan ACM API! You can use our API to access information about ACM.

We have language bindings in Shell, Ruby, and Python! You can view code examples in the dark area to the right, and you can switch the programming language of the examples with the tabs in the top right.

This example API documentation page was created with [Slate](https://github.com/tripit/slate). Feel free to edit it and use it as a base for your own API's documentation.

# Authentication

Most resources require an API key. We are using the Firebase Auth Tokens. You can find more information on the [firebase documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/admin/verify-id-tokens#retrieve_id_tokens_on_clients)

<aside class="success">
We plan on converting to standard API Keys in the future. If you want to help, let us know!
